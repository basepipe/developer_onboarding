class relativedelta(object):
    """
    The relativedelta type is designed to be applied to an existing datetime and
        can replace specific components of that datetime, or represents an interval
        of time.
    
        It is based on the specification of the excellent work done by M.-A. Lemburg
        in his
        `mx.DateTime <https://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/>`_ extension.
        However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as
        his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart.
    
        There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The
        first one is passing it two date/datetime classes::
    
            relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2)
    
        The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments::
    
            relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...)
    
            year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond:
                Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a
                relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an arithmetic
                operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the
                original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta.
    
            years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds:
                Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding
                or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs
                the corresponding arithmetic operation on the original datetime value
                with the information in the relativedelta.
    
            weekday: 
                One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc) available in the
                relativedelta module. These instances may receive a parameter N,
                specifying the Nth weekday, which could be positive or negative
                (like MO(+1) or MO(-2)). Not specifying it is the same as specifying
                +1. You can also use an integer, where 0=MO. This argument is always
                relative e.g. if the calculated date is already Monday, using MO(1)
                or MO(-1) won't change the day. To effectively make it absolute, use
                it in combination with the day argument (e.g. day=1, MO(1) for first
                Monday of the month).
    
            leapdays:
                Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap
                year, and the date found is post 28 of february.
    
            yearday, nlyearday:
                Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days).
                These are converted to day/month/leapdays information.
    
        There are relative and absolute forms of the keyword
        arguments. The plural is relative, and the singular is
        absolute. For each argument in the order below, the absolute form
        is applied first (by setting each attribute to that value) and
        then the relative form (by adding the value to the attribute).
    
        The order of attributes considered when this relativedelta is
        added to a datetime is:
    
        1. Year
        2. Month
        3. Day
        4. Hours
        5. Minutes
        6. Seconds
        7. Microseconds
    
        Finally, weekday is applied, using the rule described above.
    
        For example
    
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta, MO
        >>> dt = datetime(2018, 4, 9, 13, 37, 0)
        >>> delta = relativedelta(hours=25, day=1, weekday=MO(1))
        >>> dt + delta
        datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 2, 14, 37)
    
        First, the day is set to 1 (the first of the month), then 25 hours
        are added, to get to the 2nd day and 14th hour, finally the
        weekday is applied, but since the 2nd is already a Monday there is
        no effect.

    ``tzstr`` objects are time zone objects specified by a time-zone string as
        it would be passed to a ``TZ`` variable on POSIX-style systems (see
        the `GNU C Library: TZ Variable`_ for more details).
    
        There is one notable exception, which is that POSIX-style time zones use an
        inverted offset format, so normally ``GMT+3`` would be parsed as an offset
        3 hours *behind* GMT. The ``tzstr`` time zone object will parse this as an
        offset 3 hours *ahead* of GMT. If you would like to maintain the POSIX
        behavior, pass a ``True`` value to ``posix_offset``.
    
        The :class:`tzrange` object provides the same functionality, but is
        specified using :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` objects. rather than
        strings.

            :class:`unicode`) or a stream emitting unicode characters

        :param posix_offset:
            Optional. If set to ``True``, interpret strings such as ``GMT+3`` or
            ``UTC+3`` as being 3 hours *behind* UTC rather than ahead, per the
            POSIX standard.
